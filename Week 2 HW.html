<h3> More about Sherman’s work </h3> <p> 
In 1977, she began work on "Complete Untitled Film Stills," a series of 69 photographs and one of her best-known works; her black-and-white photographs challenged cultural stereotypes supported by the media. In the 1980s, Sherman used color film and large prints, and focused more on lighting and facial expression. She returned to ironic commentary in the 1990s, directing the dark comedy Office Killer in 1997. Three years later, in 2000, she released a series of photographs of women with exagerated attributes—a representation of social role-playing and sexual stereotypes. </p>

I had some trouble with the images, I couldn’t figure out how to source one from my computer. The iframe wasn’t working for me either. Also the links are broken because they weren’t working and I couldn’t figure them out.
