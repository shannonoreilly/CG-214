<h1 style="text-align:center;">All About Shannon</h1><p 



<p style="font-family:courier;">

What up! My name is Shannon Oâ€™Reilly. I study photography at the Fashion Institute of Technology. I love to read, watch movies, and pet dogs. My favorite kind of dog is the labrador retriever, which also happens to be the most popular dog in America. I also have a dog of my own. Her name is Socks and she is six years old. She is a labrador retriever and husky mix! </p>

<p style="font-family:courier;"> My favorite kind of food is breakfast food. They say breakfast is the most important meal of the day, but it can also be delicious. My favorite breakfast dish is a tie between waffles and pancakes! </p>
